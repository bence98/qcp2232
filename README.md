## Features

4 TTL UARTs with full Flow Control
* Tx, Rx full duplex
* RTS/CTS (Request-/Clear-to-Send), DTR/DSR (Data Terminal/Set Ready)
* DCD (Data Carrier Detect), RI (Ring Indicator) inputs
* all pins ESD protected
  * full TVS diode protection
  * overcurrent limiting resistors
* see pinout at the end of the section

UART0 and UART1 have RS-232 option
* only Tx/Rx
* separate industrial connector
  * Phoenix MCV 1,5 G-3.81
  * WÃ¼rth WR-TBL 321

UART3 has selectable TTL voltage (`Vsel`)
* 5V from USB or 3.3V from internal regulator
* UART0-2 are 3.3V

USB Type-B connector
* superior mechanical stability compared to Micro-B
* easier to handle than Mini-B
* more economical to produce than Type-C
* added noise immunity thanks to EMI suppression circuitry
* supports USB suspend mode

16 GPIOs
* 3.3V digital I/O
* all pins ESD protected
  * full TVS diode protection
  * overcurrent limiting resistors
* alternate functions, see table below
  * Tx, Rx LED: blinks on data transfer
  * Tx mode: for half duplex bus drivers eg. RS-485
  * clock: USART bit clock
* configurable via Silicon Labs' toolchain
